## Introduction
In this research, three models of consumer type prediction model, financial risk assessment model and financial recommendation service model are studied, and the user data of Lloyds Bank is analyzed through the statistical principle of Neyman stratified sampling survey. Firstly, the data is preprocessed by CatBoost algorithm, and then the data is classified by CatBoost algorithm and random forest classifier. Finally, the data are analyzed and visualized by the established model. Finally, Neyman stratified sampling method is used to analyze the bankâ€™s customer.
